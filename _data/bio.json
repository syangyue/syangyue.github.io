    "summary": " I am an avid yoga teacher and a persistent, problem-solving full-stack engineer who enjoys handling the database, programming logic, and user interface and putting it together in a cohesive product.
As someone who has nurtured a lifelong passion for technology, I am thrilled at the opportunity to apply for a software engineering position. My life is a never-ending journey of learning. Whether it’s with people, software, or yoga – there are always more things to learn and improve.
 In recent years, I have focused on building my skills in Python and JavaScript, and have gained experience with full-stack development using frameworks like Django, React, and Node. I am a dedicated learner who is always eager to expand my knowledge and capabilities.",
