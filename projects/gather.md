summary: "My team designed and developed a microservice based web application, Gather, that helps a group decide on a place to eat. It allows each group member to input a preference for cuisine type and price range. Gather generate these preferences and utilizes the Yelp API to suggest a nearby restaurant."

- Collaborated with 3 engineers to design the application using Domain Driven Design
- Adopted Yelp API to conditionally load recommended restaurants based on user preferences, significantly expanding its functionality and providing userâ€™s comprehensive experience
- Implemented authentication measures to secure user access and protect sensitive data, ensuring the safety and confidentiality of user information

For this project, I was the lead programmer who was responsible for programming both back-end and front-end authentication by using JWTdown(JSON Web Token) authentication in FastApi. Authentication in general can have a lot of moving parts, from handling password hashing and assiging tokens to validating tokens on each request.
